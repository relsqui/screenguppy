Screenguppy is a little friend to keep you company in your GNU screen session.
Specifically, it adds an extra line at the bottom (in the caption field, above
the hardline if you have one) with an ASCII fish that swims back and forth.

If you're not running screen or don't want to put a fish there, you can also
just run it in a bash loop (or use similar logic to add it to your i3 status
bar or anywhere else that you can insert script output). See
[Running Screenguppy Without Screen](#running-screenguppy-without-screen).

## Installing Screenguppy

Install screen, if necessary.

```bash
sudo apt-get screen
```

Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/relsqui/screenguppy.git

```

(You can use the SSH address instead if you have SSH keys configured on Github already.)

Make yourself a bin directory if it doesn't already exist, and then link the
Screenguppy executable into it.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
ln -s ~/screenguppy/screenguppy ~/bin
```

(Replace the first path with wherever you cloned screenguppy, if it's not
your home directory.)

Make sure that `~/bin` is already in your `$PATH` by trying to run:

```bash
screenguppy
```

If it prints a single line with a fish on it, you're golden. If not,
add this line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"
```

And then re-execute that file:

```bash
source .bashrc
```

Now you should be able to run `screenguppy` and see one fish.


## Running Screenguppy Without Screen

If you just want to watch the animated fish without setting it up in your
screen caption line (or you already have a caption line, don't use screen,
etc.) then you can run the script independently in a bash loop, like so:

```bash
while true; do
  clear
  screenguppy
  sleep 1
done
```

Type `ctrl-c` to stop.


## Adding Screenguppy to Screen

Open your `~/.screenrc` file in a text editor. Do a quick search for any
lines that already have the command `backtick` in them. If you don't find any
(including if the file is brand new), add these lines to the end of the file:

```
backtick 1 1 1 screenguppy
caption always '%{yk}%=%1`%='
```

If there are some backtick lines, find the highest number that appears right
after the word `backtick`, then add one to it and note the result. For example,
if you saw `backtick 1` and `backtick 2`, note `3`.

Add the following lines to the end of the file, substituting your noted number
for `N` in both places (once per line).


```
backtick N 1 1 screenguppy
caption always '%{yk}%=%N`%='
```

NOTE: If you already have a `caption` command in your `.screenrc` file,
that line and Screenguppy can't work at the same time. If you're not sure
which one you want to keep, you can comment out the other one temporarily
by adding a # at the beginning of that line.

Finally, if you're already running a screen, refresh the configuration
by typing `C-a :` and then `source ~/.screenrc`. If you see errors about
the screenguppy command not being found, type `C-a :` again and then
`setenv PATH "$PATH:$HOME/bin"`. 

If you're not running a screen yet, type `screen` to start one.

Enjoy your fishy friend!


## Adding Screenguppy to Tmux

Open your `~/.tmux.conf` file in a text editor, or create it if it's not
already there. See if you can find any lines setting either `status-left` or
`status-right`. If none are present, just add the following line:

```
set -g status-left '#(bin/screenguppy)'
```

If you do have status lines in the config, and add to one of them the text
`#(bin/screenguppy)` (or if you want to pass a different width, say 20, add
`#(bin/screenguppy 20`).

For example, the default value for `status-left` is `[#S] ` (which prints the session name). To add the guppy here, we'll add this line:

`set -g status-left '[#S] #(bin/screenguppy'`

Once you modify your config, you can reload it in tmux without restarting, by
running the following command in any tmux shell:

```
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```


## Advanced Customization

* The `%{yb}` part of the caption line in `.screenrc` defines the fish and
  background colors. See the
  [String Escapes section of the GNU Screen Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/html_node/String-Escapes.html)
  for other options.
* Screenguppy assumes your terminal is at least 80 characters wide and uses no
  more of it than that. You can give your fish more or less room to swim by
  passing the width as the first argument, or by editing the WIDTH variable in
  the `screenguppy` executable.
* You can change the fish ASCII art (for example, removing the Unicode if your
  terminal doesn't support it) by editing the RFISH and LFISH variables in the
  `screenguppy` executable (the right-facing and left-facing versions,
  respectively).
  * It doesn't even have to be a static string. You can put a clock in there,
    or your machine's uptime, or anything else you know how to add to a string
    in Python.
  * If RFISH and LFISH are different lengths, and WIDTH is set near the actual
    width of your terminal, the padding might overflow and print extra spaces
    on the next line.
* You can change the fish's speed by changing the SPEED variable in the
  `screenguppy` executable. This doesn't change how often it moves (which is
  capped at once per second by screen itself), but how far it moves each time.
  * SPEED doesn't have to be an integer, but the distance will always be rounded
    to whole characters.
  * If SPEED is less than 1, the fish will sometimes skip its move.
  * If SPEED is negative, the fish will swim backwards.


## Removing Screenguppy

You can remove Screenguppy from your screen by deleting the two lines you added
to your `.screenrc` file. If you have a screen open that you would like to keep
running, refresh its configuration by typing `C-a :` and then
`source ~/.screenrc`.

You can also delete Screenguppy entirely just by removing the directory it's in
and the link you created:

```bash
rm -rf ~/screenguppy # or wherever you cloned it
rm ~/bin/screenguppy
```
